# **Project Requirements Document: JobFinder Website**

The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements of the JobFinder website, a platform that aggregates job postings from across the internet and lets users curate, publish, and share collections of roles.

| Requirement ID | Description                       | User Story                                                                                                              | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FR001**      | Creating a New Job List           | As a user, I want to start a new, empty job list so I can begin collecting openings that match my interests.            | The system should provide a clearly visible **“New List”** button. Clicking it creates a draft list (private by default) and navigates the user to an empty list-view that prompts them to add search criteria or individual job URLs.                                                                                                                   |
| **FR002**      | Adding Jobs to a List             | As a user, I want to add jobs to my list—either by pasting a posting URL or by running a keyword/location search—so I can compile relevant roles. | The interface should offer (a) an input field for adding a job-posting URL and (b) a **“Search Jobs”** panel where users enter keywords, filters (location, remote, salary range, tech stack, etc.), and select results to add. The system fetches metadata (title, company, description, logo) via its crawler/API and appends each selected posting to the list. |
| **FR003**      | Viewing Jobs in a List            | As a user, I want to see all the jobs I’ve added so I can review, sort, and manage them.                                 | The list view should render each job in a card/table row showing: title, company, location, salary (if available), date posted, and a link back to the source. Users can sort by date, salary, or company and collapse/expand long descriptions.                                                                                                            |
| **FR004**      | Editing Jobs in a List            | As a user, I want to edit the details of a job (e.g., notes, priority tag) in my list.                                   | Each job card offers an **“Edit”** action to modify meta-fields stored locally (e.g., personal note, priority) without altering the original scraped data. Changes are saved instantly via AJAX and reflected in the UI.                                                                                                                                |
| **FR005**      | Deleting Jobs from a List         | As a user, I want to remove a job from my list if it’s no longer relevant.                                               | Each job entry includes a delete icon with a confirmation dialog. Upon confirmation, the posting is removed from the list and the change is persisted.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **FR006**      | Customizing the List URL          | As a user, I want to choose a custom URL slug for my list so it’s memorable and easy to share.                          | An input field lets users specify a slug (e.g., *ai-roles-london*). The system validates uniqueness and character rules in real time, surfacing an error if the slug is taken.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **FR007**      | Automatic URL Generation          | As a user, if I don’t care about a custom slug, I want the system to auto-generate one.                                  | If the slug field is left blank, the backend creates a unique, human-friendly slug (e.g., *list-8Z4Q9*). The slug is stored and displayed to the user after list creation.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **FR008**      | Publishing a List                 | As a user, I want to publish my list so others can view the collection.                                                  | Clicking **“Publish”** switches the list from *draft* to *public*. The system timestamps the publish action, locks the slug, and begins a nightly refresh job to verify each posting is still live, marking expired ones.                                                                                                                             |
| **FR009**      | Sharing a List                    | As a user, I want to easily share my list through various channels.                                                      | After publishing, the UI shows the list’s URL with a **“Copy Link”** button and social-share icons (email, X/Twitter, LinkedIn).                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **FR010**      | Accessing a Shared List           | As a recipient, I want to view the jobs in the shared list by clicking the link.                                         | Visiting the link loads a public, read-only view of the list with the same job cards. If a posting has expired, it’s labeled *“No longer active”*. Responsive design ensures usability on mobile.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **FR011**      | Viewing All Lists                 | As a user, I want a dashboard of all my lists so I can manage them easily.                                               | A **My Lists** page shows cards for each list with status (draft/public), job count, last updated, and quick actions (edit, delete, duplicate, view stats).                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **FR012**      | Deleting a List                   | As a user, I want to delete an entire list if I no longer need it.                                                       | From the dashboard or list settings, a **“Delete List”** option opens a confirmation modal. On confirmation, the list and its jobs are soft-deleted (30-day restore window) and the slug becomes available again.                                                                                                                                    |
